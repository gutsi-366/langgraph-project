# TRUE LLM-Powered E-commerce User Behavior Analysis

## Executive Summary
This report was generated using a TRUE LLM-powered LangGraph system where AI agents dynamically generated and executed Python code for data analysis.

## Methodology
### Multi-Agent Workflow:
1. **Planning Agent**: Analyzed dataset and created analysis plan
2. **Code Generation Agent**: Generated Python code for each analysis step
3. **Execution Agent**: Safely executed the generated code
4. **Reporting Agent**: Synthesized all results into this report

## Analysis Steps Completed
1. **Data Quality Analysis**
   - Status: success
   - Output: Code executed successfully
2. **User Behavior Analysis**
   - Status: success
   - Output: Code executed successfully
3. **Purchase Pattern Analysis**
   - Status: success
   - Output: Code executed successfully
4. **Visualization Generation**
   - Status: success
   - Output: Code executed successfully

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: LangGraph with dynamic agent workflow
- **Code Generation**: LLM-powered Python code creation
- **Execution**: Safe subprocess execution with timeouts
- **Visualization**: Automated chart generation

## Generated Code Summary
Total analysis steps with generated code: 0
