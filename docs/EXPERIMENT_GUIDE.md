# LangGraph Agent Development Experiment Guide

## Overview

This guide demonstrates the complete workflow for developing LangGraph agents for e-commerce user behavior analysis, following the methodology described in the experiment documentation.

## Experiment Structure

### 1. Environment Setup ✅

Your project includes:
- **Python 3.12+** compatibility
- **Complete dependencies** in `requirements.txt`
- **Environment configuration** with `.env.template`
- **Cursor IDE integration** ready

### 2. LangGraph Multi-Agent Architecture ✅

Your implementation includes:

```
Planning Agent → Code Generation Agent → Execution Agent → Progress Tracker → Reporting Agent
```

Each agent has specific responsibilities:
- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes dataset and creates analysis plan
- **Code Generation Agent**: Generates Python code for each analysis step
- **Execution Agent**: Safely executes generated code with timeouts
- **Progress Tracker**: Monitors completion and manages workflow
- **Reporting Agent**: Synthesizes results into comprehensive reports

### 3. LLM-Powered Code Generation ✅

Your system implements the core concept from the experiment:

```python
# Example from your langgraph_agent.py
def code_generation_agent(state: AnalysisState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """LLM generates Python code for the current analysis step"""
    prompt = f"""
    You are a Python data analysis expert. Generate Python code to perform: {current_step}
    
    CONTEXT:
    {dataset_info}
    
    REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Load the dataset from: '{fixed_path}'
    2. Perform analysis for: {current_step}
    3. Generate insights and visualizations
    4. Save results to a variable called `analysis_results`
    """
```

### 4. Data Processing & Visualization ✅

Your enhanced agent includes:
- **Automated data processing** with validation
- **ML-powered analytics** (segmentation, anomaly detection, CLV prediction)
- **Dynamic visualization generation** with matplotlib/plotly
- **Statistical analysis** with comprehensive insights

### 5. Report Generation ✅

Your system generates:
- **Executive summaries** with business insights
- **Technical analysis reports** in Markdown format
- **Visualization exports** to `outputs/plots/`
- **Structured data** for further analysis

## Running the Experiment

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd langgraph_project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

### Step 2: Run LangGraph Agent

```bash
# Run the main agent
python src/main.py

# Or run directly
python -c "from src.langgraph_agent import run_agent; run_agent()"
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

Check the generated outputs:
- `outputs/report.md` - Comprehensive analysis report
- `outputs/plots/` - Generated visualizations
- `outputs/runs/` - Analysis session data

## Advanced Features (Beyond Basic Experiment)

Your implementation includes advanced features not covered in the basic experiment:

### 1. Enhanced Analytics
- **Customer Segmentation**: K-means clustering with PCA visualization
- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest for fraud detection
- **CLV Prediction**: Random Forest with feature importance
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Executive summaries with recommendations

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-level caching system
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent analysis operations
- **Memory Management**: Efficient DataFrame operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time operation timing

### 3. Security & Validation
- **Input Validation**: File upload and data validation
- **Security Auditing**: Event logging and monitoring
- **Data Sanitization**: XSS and injection prevention
- **Access Control**: Rate limiting and authentication

### 4. Modern UI/UX
- **Streamlit Interface**: Interactive web application
- **Enhanced Components**: Modern styling and animations
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators and feedback
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Real-time validation display
